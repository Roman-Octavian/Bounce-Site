## Project Description
This is a (semi) responsive landing page for [Bounce](https://github.com/Roman-Octavian/Bounce), a native full-stack application. The goals of this
second part of the project can be ascertained in the [project requirements](meta/Mandatory%20II.pdf).

This website is a simple medium through which the "Bouncing Spheres" application has been deployed. It offers information and downloads
similar to the README of the Bounce repository, but slightly more detailed, and in a web page format.

Bounce-Site has a MySQL back-end connection facilitated by Java Spring to serve statistics which are generated inside the native application right on the welcome screen.

Visit the live, Heroku-hosted website at the following URL:
